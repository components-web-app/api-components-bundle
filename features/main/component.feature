Feature: Components
  In order to create a component
  As an API user
  I can add extend AbstractComponent

  Background:
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"

  # Needs to be an admin as we are putting component in a page data resource which is not routed and so not accessible to anonymous
  @loginAdmin
  Scenario: I can get a component's usage
    Given there is a DummyComponent in PageData and a Position
    When I send a "GET" request to the resource "dummy_component" and the postfix "/usage"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON node "positionCount" should be equal to 1
    And the JSON node "pageDataCount" should be equal to 1
    And the JSON node "total" should be equal to 2

  @loginUser
  Scenario: I can create a component
    When I send a "POST" request to "/component/dummy_components" with body:
    """
    {
      "uiComponent": "AnotherComponent",
      "uiClassNames": ["my-class"]
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "component.schema.json"
    And the JSON node "@context" should be equal to "/contexts/DummyComponent"
    And the JSON node "uiComponent" should be equal to "AnotherComponent"
    And the JSON node "uiClassNames[0]" should be equal to "my-class"

  @loginUser
  Scenario: I can create a component and the ComponentPosition at the same time
    Given there is a ComponentCollection with 0 components and the ID "41c57f7a-9f69-11ea-8188-acde48001122"
    When I send a "POST" request to "/component/dummy_components" with body:
    """
    {
      "componentPositions": [
        {
          "componentCollection": "/_/component_collections/41c57f7a-9f69-11ea-8188-acde48001122"
        }
      ]
    }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "component.schema.json"
    And I save the JSON node "@id" as the resource "new_component"
    And I save the JSON node "componentPositions[0]" as the resource "new_component_position"
    Then I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "GET" request to the resource "new_component_position"
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "component_position.schema.json"
    And the JSON node "componentCollection" should be equal to the string "/_/component_collections/41c57f7a-9f69-11ea-8188-acde48001122"
    And the JSON node "component" should be equal to the IRI of the resource "new_component"

  @loginUser
  Scenario: I can delete a component
    Given there is a DummyComponent
    When I send a "DELETE" request to the resource "dummy_component"
    Then the response status code should be 204

  @loginAdmin
  Scenario Outline: A component still in use is not deleted
    Given there is a DummyComponent in PageData and a Position
    When I send a "DELETE" request to the resource "<resource>"
    Then the response status code should be 204
    And the resource dummy_component should exist
  Examples:
    | resource           |
    | page_data          |
    | component_position |

  @loginAdmin
  Scenario: An orphaned component is deleted
    Given there is a PageData resource with the route path "/"
    When I send a "DELETE" request to the resource "page_data"
    Then the response status code should be 204
    And the resource dummy_component should not exist
