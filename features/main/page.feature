Feature: Page resources
  In order to create a page resource
  As an API user
  I can access the page endpoint and perform CRUD

  Background:
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"

  Scenario Outline: I can create a page
    Given there is a ComponentGroup with 0 components
    And there is a Layout
    And there are 2 Routes
    When I send a "POST" request to "/_/pages" with data:
      | route    | parentRoute      | layout    | ComponentGroup   | reference   | title   | metaDescription   | nested    | uiComponent   | isTemplate   |
      | <route>  | <parentRoute>    | <layout>  | <ComponentGroup> | <reference> | <title> | <metaDescription> | <nested>  | <uiComponent> | <isTemplate> |
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "page.schema.json"
    Examples:
      | route              | parentRoute            | layout             | ComponentGroup            | reference | title     | metaDescription | nested | uiComponent      | isTemplate |
      | resource[route_0]  | resource[route_1]      | resource[layout]   | resource[component_group] | home      | Home page | my meta         | false  | myComponent      | true       |
      | null               | null                   | resource[layout]   | null                           | home      | null      | null            | true   | myComponent      | false      |

  Scenario Outline: The page resource validates correctly
    Given there is a Layout
    When I send a "POST" request to "/_/pages" with data:
      | layout    | reference   | nested    | uiComponent   | isTemplate |
      | <layout>  | <reference> | false     | <uiComponent> | false      |
    Then the response status code should be 422
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "validation_errors_object.schema.json"
    And the JSON node "violations[0].propertyPath" should be equal to "<propertyPath>"
    And the JSON node "violations[0].message" should be equal to "<message>"
    Examples:
      | layout             | reference | propertyPath       | message                                    | uiComponent    |
      | null               | home      | layout             | Please specify a layout.                   | myComponent    |
      | resource[layout]   |           | reference          | Please enter a reference.                  | myComponent    |
      | resource[layout]   | home      | uiComponent        | Please specify a UI component.             |                |

  Scenario Outline: The page resource returns errors on incorrect data types
    Given there is a Layout
    When I send a "POST" request to "/_/pages" with data:
      | layout    | reference   | nested    | isTemplate |
      | <layout>  | <reference> | <nested>  | false      |
    Then the response status code should be 500
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema file "error.schema.json"
    And the JSON node "hydra:description" should be equal to the string '<message>'
    Examples:
      | layout             | reference | nested | message                                                               |
      | resource[layout]   | home      | null   | The type of the "nested" attribute must be "bool", "NULL" given.      |
      | resource[layout]   | null      | true   | The type of the "reference" attribute must be "string", "NULL" given. |

  Scenario: I can delete a page
    Given there is a Page
    When I send a "DELETE" request to the resource "page"

    Given there is a Page with the reference "primary"
    And there is a Page with the reference "secondary"

    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON node "hydra:member" should have "1" elements
    And the JSON node "hydra:member[0].reference" should be equal to "primary"

  @loginAdmin
  Scenario: The page resources can be filtered by title
