Feature: Form component that defines a form type created in the application
  In order to provide a form to the front-end application
  As an application / client
  I need to be able to create the component and receive serialized forms with validation and submission endpoints

  Background:
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
