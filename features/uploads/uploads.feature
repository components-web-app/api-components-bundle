Feature: API Resources which can have files uploaded
  In order to create a resource with a file
  As an API user
  I need to be able to create a resource and upload a file

  Background:
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"

  # POST

  @loginUser
  Scenario Outline: I can create a new dummy files component with a json base64 data (and dataURI as that is how symfony serializes text files)
    When I send a "POST" request to "/dummy_uploadables" with data:
      | file           |
      | base64(<file>) |
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema "features/assets/schema/<schema>"
    And the JSON node "filePath" should not exist
    Examples:
      | file           | schema                           |
      | image.svg      | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | image.png      | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | test_file.txt  | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | test_file.docx | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |

  Scenario Outline: I can create a new dummy files component with base64 data that is just a string (no data:)
    When I send a "POST" request to "/dummy_uploadables" with data:
      | file                 |
      | base64string(<file>) |
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema "features/assets/schema/<schema>"
    And the JSON node "filePath" should not exist
    Examples:

      | image.svg | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |

  @loginUser
  Scenario Outline: I can create a new dummy files component with a "multipart/form-data" request
    Given I add "Content-Type" header equal to "multipart/form-data"
    When I send a "POST" request to "/dummy_uploadables/upload" with parameters:
      | key  | value   |
      | file | @<file> |
    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the JSON should be valid according to the schema "features/assets/schema/<schema>"
    And the JSON node "filePath" should not exist
    Examples:
      | file           | schema                           |
      | image.png      | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | image.svg      | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | test_file.txt  | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
      | test_file.docx | uploadable_has_files.schema.json |
