# Uploadable

## Requirements
This bundle uses FlySystem v2. It does not use additional bundles. Instead, you create your adapters as Symfony services with a specific tag, so that they are injected into the `FilesystemProvider`.

Configuration example in `services.php`
```php
use League\Flysystem\Local\LocalFilesystemAdapter;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Flysystem\FilesystemProvider;

$services
        ->set(LocalFilesystemAdapter::class)
        ->args([
            '%kernel.project_dir%/var/storage/default'
        ])
        ->tag(FilesystemProvider::FILESYSTEM_ADAPTER_TAG, [ 'alias' => 'local' ]);
```

Or Yaml:
```yaml
app.flysystem.adapter.local:
    class: League\Flysystem\Local\LocalFilesystemAdapter
    arguments: ['%kernel.project_dir%/var/storage/default']
    tag:
      - { name: 'silverback.api_components.filesystem_adapter', alias: 'local' }
```

Install the adapters you need from Flysystem and remember to use adapters supporting version 2 (e.g. `composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3:^2`)

## Integration with LiipImagineBundle (optional)

If you are using the [LiipImagineBundle](https://github.com/liip/LiipImagineBundle), this bundle will automatically add a service for each filesystem configured so that you can use to wire into our `DataLoader` and `CacheResolver` classes. These are the services you will need to use with Imagine. The above filesystem will be available as `api_components.filesystem.local` where `local` is the alias you have chosen for the adapter.

This will also create a mapping table in your database to store file information as it is being saved or removed from the cache.

### Define your Data Loader

#### Imagine Bundle Configuration

We use our own binary provider so that we can use the filesystem you have defined on your `UploadableField` annotation.

```yaml
liip_imagine:
    data_loader: silverback.api_components.liip_imagine.binary.loader
```

or on a specific filter set

```yaml
liip_imagine:
    filter_sets:
        my_special_style:
            data_loader: silverback.api_components.liip_imagine.binary.loader
            filters:
                # your filters
```

### Define Your Cache Resolver

You can choose to create your own cache resolvers and store the cached Imagine images wherever you like.

#### Example Service Configuration

```yaml
services:
    app.imagine.cache.resolver.local:
        class: Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Imagine\FlysystemCacheResolver
        arguments:
            $filesystem: "@api_components.filesystem.local" # required
            $rootUrl: 'http://images.example.com' # required
            $cachePrefix: 'media/cache' # optional, this is default value
            $visibility: 'public'  # optional, this is default value
        tags:
          - { name: "liip_imagine.cache.resolver", resolver: custom_cache_resolver }
```

> This is the equivalent way to configure what is outlined in the documentation [here](https://symfony.com/doc/2.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/cache-resolver/flysystem.html)

#### Imagine Bundle Configuration

```yaml
liip_imagine:
    cache: custom_cache_resolver
```

or on a specific filter set

```yaml
liip_imagine:
    filter_sets:
        my_special_style:
            cache: custom_cache_resolver
```

## Usage

The easiest way to configure an entity resource be an uploadable file is to use the following annotation and trait:

```php
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Entity\Utility\UploadableTrait;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Annotation as Silverback;

 #[Silverback\Uploadable]
class File
{
    use UploadableTrait;

    #[Silverback\UploadableField(adapter: "local")]
    public ?File $file;
```

### Resolving Imagine Filters

### Annotation

You can configure static imagine filters to resolve in the UploadableField annotation.

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Annotation as Silverback;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Entity\Utility\UploadableTrait;

 #[Silverback\Uploadable]
class File
{
    use UploadableTrait;
    
    #[Silverback\UploadableField(adapter: "local", imageineFilters: ['thumbnail', 'thumbnail_square'])]
    public ?File $file;
```

### ImagineFiltersInterface
You can configure your `File` object to use ImagineBundle filters. You will receive an additional `MediaObject` for every filter configured. The method `getImagineFilters` receives the configured `@UploadedField` property name (in the example below this would be `file`), and a `Request` object or `null`. If the resource is not a file supported by Imagine or no files are uploaded, the filters will be ignored.

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Annotation as Silverback;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Entity\Utility\UploadableTrait;
use Silverback\ApiComponentsBundle\Entity\Utility\ImagineFiltersInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

 #[Silverback\Uploadable]
class File implements ImagineFiltersInterface
{
    use UploadableTrait;
    
    #[Silverback\UploadableField(adapter: "local")]
    public ?File $file;

    public function getImagineFilters(string $property, ?Request $request): array
    {
        return ['thumbnail', 'square_placeholder'];
    }
```

Due to the way LiipImagineBundle works, we save the image metadata when the cached file is saved to your storage. We keep this data in another database table. This means we will call your `getImagineFilters` method when you upload your file with a `null` argument for `$request`. If a file has not been saved into the cache at the time it is requested, it will be generated at runtime so the first request will take longer. You could also resolve the cache in the background. To do this you would return no filters if there is a `null` request parameter and listen for the API Platform event lifecycle event for your resource(s). See https://symfony.com/doc/2.0/bundles/LiipImagineBundle/resolve-cache-images-in-background.html for configuring the background process.

## Updating your resource

You can, and usually should send your file to the API as a Base64 encoded string, adhering to the REST API standards. However, for every resource configured, you can also submit just your file to your resources endpoint and `/upload` appended. This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` mime type.

E.g. if your component's endpoint is `/component/image_uploadable_components` you can submit POST requests to `/component/image_uploadable_components/upload` and `PUT` or `PATCH` requests to `/component/image_uploadable_components/{id}/upload`

## Output

Your `Uploadable` resources will not return your configured file paths. These are for internal use and do not provide a publicly accessible endpoint to the files. Instead, we populate media objects into the returned metadata. There will be an array for every `UploadableField` configured. Here is an example of a resource just using the example configuration shown above.
```json
{
    "@context": "/contexts/DummyUploadable",
    "@id": "/component/dummy_uploadables/0a1b1d75c1114be285b037b4f8e0d6c4",
    "@type": "DummyUploadable",
    "_metadata": {
        "persisted": true,
        "media_objects": {
            "file": [
                {
                    "@context": {
                        "@vocab": "http://example.com/docs.jsonld#",
                        "hydra": "http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#",
                        "contentUrl": "http://schema.org/contentUrl",
                        "fileSize": "MediaObject/fileSize",
                        "mimeType": "http://schema.org/encodingFormat",
                        "width": "http://schema.org/width",
                        "height": "http://schema.org/height",
                        "imagineFilter": "MediaObject/imagineFilter",
                        "formattedFileSize": "http://schema.org/contentSize"
                    },
                    "@id": "/media_objects/6da1e63232d64fcea6b204c119a5d67f",
                    "@type": "http://schema.org/MediaObject",
                    "contentUrl": "http://example.com/dummy_uploadables/16c14fffc1854ee7860a8cef912922b5/download/file",
                    "fileSize": 3467,
                    "mimeType": "image/png",
                    "formattedFileSize": "3.4KB",
                    "_metadata": {
                        "persisted": false
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

If the `MediaObject` is not an image, you will not receive with `width` or `height` properties. If the object is not a result of an ImagineBundle filter, you will not receive the property `imagineFilter`.

## Future features

The `@context` has been embedded into every MediaObject instance returned for your convenience. There is a pending feature that we would like to add where we could define a schema definition that is a subclass of `MediaObject` in the `@ApiProperty` annotation but this has not been developed yet.
