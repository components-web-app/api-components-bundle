# API Components Bundle Documentation

>__Creates a flexible API for a website's structure, reusable components and common functionality.__

## Introduction
This bundle provides an extremely flexible API with functionality to provide the data structure and functionality for front-end web applications. With this bundle you can build website data by defining re-usable `components` for the front-end web application and define everything you would need to create a fully-featured website including an intuitive CMS.

We build this bundle 'on the shoulders of giants' with large and active communities, and will not be reinventing anything which has already been created in the fantastic packages we primarily use.
- [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) (Framework)
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) (Database ORM/ODM)
- [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) (REST/GraphQL API Framework)

And for authentication [LexikJwtBundle](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle) and [JWTRefreshTokenBundle](https://github.com/markitosgv/JWTRefreshTokenBundle) - although these bundles have less support than the main frameworks, the security they provide plays a big part in this bundle.

The teams behind these packages are fantastic, be sure to __buy them a beer__ if you ever bump into anyone involved! :beer:

> __Want a free and easy way to show your thanks for packages you use? Use the [`symfony/thanks`](https://github.com/symfony/thanks) composer package - share the love :heart:, share the stars :star:__

There is also a front-end application in development to accompany this bundle, and when complete it will demonstrate the wide range of benefits this will provide.
